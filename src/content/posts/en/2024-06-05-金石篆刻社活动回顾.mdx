# ✨ Jinshi Seal Engraving Club Activity Highlights  
## 🗓️ 2nd Session: March 26, 2024  
## 🗓️ 3rd Session: June 5, 2024  

In both breezy spring and early summer, Jinshi Seal Engraving Club held its 2nd and 3rd official club events! 🌟

We were honored to invite both teachers and students to join us. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, participants learned basic knife techniques and practiced sketching seal designs.

🪨 The best part? Everyone got to carve their *very own* seal! Some chose their names, others picked their favorite animals—from cats and dogs to birds and wild beasts—each seal was a unique creation full of personality and imagination.

Through hands-on learning, members gained a deeper appreciation of this traditional art form and enjoyed the peaceful joy of crafting with their own hands.

Join us next time and carve your story in stone!
