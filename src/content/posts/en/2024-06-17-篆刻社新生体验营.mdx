# Jinshi Seal Engraving Club Welcomes Newcomers!  
## 📅 Date: June 17, 2024  
## 📍 Hefei No.1 High School · US Program Experience Camp

Right after the high school entrance exam, a group of bright junior high graduates stepped into Hefei No.1 High School’s **International Curriculum Experience Camp**. In addition to exploring diverse international courses, they also joined hands-on club sessions—and guess what? The Jinshi Seal Engraving Club totally stole the spotlight! ✨

🪨 During the workshop, students learned about the history of seal engraving, got to see the tools up close, watched a carving demonstration, and even created their own mini seals—some carved cats, pandas, and rabbits. Each tiny stone became a symbol of their first hands-on connection with Chinese tradition.

💬 Feedback from students:  
“Seal engraving is so cool!”  
“I felt super focused when carving—it’s almost meditative.”  
“I didn’t expect this ancient art to be so creative and fun!”

We look forward to seeing these young creators again—maybe as full-time Jinshi Club members in the near future! 🧑‍🎨🎓
