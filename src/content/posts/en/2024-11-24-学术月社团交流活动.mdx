# 🏛️ Hefei No.1 High School Education Group · Academic Month  
### — Triluminous Club Shares the Beauty of Tradition

🗓️ **November 24, 2024** — As autumn deepens, the “Academic Month” Club Exchange Event hosted by the Hefei No.1 High School Education Group was held at the Danfu Hall. Outstanding student clubs gathered at the 1st floor Academic Hall of the Boxing Building to showcase their passions and accomplishments.

🎨 Triluminous Club, known on campus for promoting traditional Chinese culture, proudly participated in the event. Through posters, stamp displays, and live demonstrations, the club introduced the history of seal engraving, basic techniques, and how this ancient art form continues to inspire in modern life.

🧱 Members also brought carved seal stones and red ink pads, inviting students and teachers to experience the joy of stamping firsthand. The interactive activity drew great interest—many participants were amazed by the delicate craftsmanship and expressed a desire to learn more about the art of seal carving.

🎯 This event not only increased awareness of seal engraving but also allowed Triluminous Club to shine in an academic setting, reflecting a unique blend of art, culture, and tradition. Moving forward, the club will remain committed to its motto:  
**"Imprint the spirit, carve the heart"** — passing down the beauty of Chinese heritage through hands-on creation and artistic expression.
