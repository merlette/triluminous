## 🖋️ From Carving to Exhibition — Our New Cultural Home

Since its founding, Triluminous Club has been devoted to promoting traditional Chinese seal carving art and cultural heritage.  
We have hosted dozens of workshops and hands-on activities, where members carved seals like “Top of the List” and “Land the Offer,” expressing their hopes and blessings. Our seal art has deeply resonated with the campus community during various exhibitions and market events.

At the 2025 Hefei No.1 High School Business Festival, our handmade seal works received enthusiastic praise, achieving a wonderful blend of culture and creativity. During the Club Festival and the Hefei Arts Festival, we collaborated with Calligraphy, Paper Art, and other clubs to enrich campus cultural life with authentic Chinese traditions.

## 🧱 Why Do We Need This Activity Room?

🔸 Growing membership requires more space  
🔸 Expanding curriculum including upcoming pottery and quilling projects  
🔸 Seal carving demands a quiet, clean environment  
🔸 A fixed venue to store tools, stones, and artworks safely

📍 **The 5th Floor Activity Room in the Administration Building**  
Spacious, well-equipped, and conveniently located — it will be our new base for creation and exchange!
