## 🏮 Refined Gathering Lectures

> Through art we forge friendships, through literature we connect hearts; gather around for a moment, and listen to the voices of past and present.

Refined gatherings trace their origins to the assemblies of ancient literati and cultured scholars. Today, we revive this tradition through lectures, bringing forth the splendor and wisdom of traditional culture. At Sanming Society, we regularly host various art lectures and cultural salons, allowing traditional arts to flourish anew through exchange and dialogue.
