## 🧧 Seal Carving Arts

> One seal, one legacy; within the confines of an inch, carving the spiritual art of Chinese characters.

Seal carving is the convergence of calligraphy, painting, and sculpture—an artistic dialogue between lines and composition. At Triluminous Society, through seal script learning, compositional layout, knife technique training, and personal creation, we guide each member to experience the beauty of seal carving.
