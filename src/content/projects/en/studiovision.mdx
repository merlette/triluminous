Seal Carving Art Studio specializes in traditional Chinese seal carving and contemporary visual arts. The project required developing a modern and responsive website that would reflect the studio's sophisticated aesthetic and cultural heritage.

The site was built using cutting-edge technologies like React and TailwindCSS, with special attention to smooth animations and elegant transitions. The minimalist user interface highlights the work portfolio through an interactive and dynamic gallery.

Key project features:
- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- Custom animations to enhance user experience
- Headless CMS for simplified content management
- Advanced SEO optimization
- Fast loading times through lazy loading techniques

The final result is an elegant and performant website that perfectly represents the client's professional identity and artistic tradition.
